# Python Task

## Correctness:
Inside the sorted function call, there is a join method which does niot have argumentspasses, this can cause a syntax error. If this is fixed the correctnesss of the function will be good. The fuction is expected to do exactly what it is intended to do.

## Efficiency:
- The implementation of the anagram is correct, however the are  some syntax error that needs to fixed.
- The solution works best for small inputs or projects however if we are working with large inputs it may not be as effective.

## Style:
The code is well written, Try and give descriptive names to variables if possible.
- The variable results (line 3) is good, however you can name it as grouped_anagrams or simply just anagrams
- The varibale x (line 5) could be named dict_key, as you are using it as a dictionary_key string (lines 7 & 9)
- There are no comments in the code, which makes it harder to understand the logic behind the code.
## Documentation:
The code does not have any documentation, which makes it harder to understand the logic behind the code but since it is a small project it is understandable however for future projects try to have documentation for all programs

## Postive Aspects:
From line  through 12, the code is simple, readable and easy to follow. The function checks for anagrams in the given list of strings and groups them together as expected.

## Improvements:
 ##### Your code looks great and it provides the desired output. However there are a few small changes I would suggest that will go a long way in your coding journey.
- Always try and keep the code block simple to reduce unnecesary lines of code, it also improves readablity for other developers when reviewing your code.
- Add detailed comments explaining how the code works so the next person will have an idea of what is happening.
- Try to use descriptive variable names so the code can be understandable and you will not forget them.
- line 3 ,line 4 ,line 10 and line 11 have indentation error, try to fix that
